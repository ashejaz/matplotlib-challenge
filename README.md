# overview
For this project, Pandas, Matplotlib-PyPlot, SciPy and NumPy were utilised in Jupyter notebook to manipulate and visualise data from a pharmaceutical study.

Two .csv files were loaded, joined and the results analysed to produce a series of graphs and charts. Statistical analysis and linear regression were performed to measure correlation between factors.

# files
All relevant files are contained with the 'Pymaceuticals' folder.
The script used is titled 'pymaceuticals.ipynb'. The analysis of results is written at the top of the notebook.
Both source files 'Mouse_metadata.csv' and 'Study_results.csv' are located within the 'data' folder.
